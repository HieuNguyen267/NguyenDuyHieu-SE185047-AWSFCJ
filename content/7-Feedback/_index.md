### General Evaluation

**1. Working environment**  
AWS feels professional without being rigid. Teammates are approachable, quick to unblock issues, and open to questions, so I’m comfortable raising problems. The vibe is focused but not tense, which helps me stay productive and confident on real deliverables.

**2. Support from mentor / team admin**  
Mentors don’t hand out answers; they walk me through how to reason about problems, from AWS concepts to team processes. That guidance has made me more independent while still feeling supported.

**3. Alignment between work and my major**  
I study Software Engineering and contribute to the clickstream initiative, integrating AWS services. It maps directly to what I learned—coding, systems, and architecture—while exposing me to real cloud workloads, clarifying my career direction.

**4. Learning opportunities & skill development**  
The internship blends technical growth with project practice. I’ve leveled up collaboration and communication in a professional setting and learned to exchange feedback constructively.

**5. Culture & team spirit**  
The culture is respectful and collaborative. We solve technical issues together and aim for shared project outcomes, so even as an intern I feel trusted and part of the team.

**6. Policies / benefits for interns**  
Beyond daily work, I joined ~4–5 AWS-hosted events covering tech and industry topics. They broadened my perspective, kept me current, and expanded my network—making the internship more valuable.
