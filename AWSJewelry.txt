1	BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
1.1	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The AWS Jewelry Web project entails the development of a comprehensive Jewelry E-commerce Platform. The system architecture comprises a backend and database infrastructure hosted on AWS Lightsail, coupled with a React-based frontend deployed via Amazon S3 and CloudFront. This architecture is designed to ensure scalability, high security, and operational cost optimization by leveraging essential yet highly effective Cloud services.

The system provides the following key features:
•	Jewelry product management.
•	Product image uploading capabilities.
•	Shopping cart functionality.
•	User registration and authentication via AWS Cognito.
•	Backend API operations on Lightsail with MySQL/Postgres data storage.
•	Content delivery acceleration and international standard SSL processing via CDN.
1.2	PROJECT SUCCESS CRITERIA
•	Performance: Website load time under 2 seconds for international access, facilitated by CloudFront CDN.
•	Stability: Backend operates stably on Lightsail under actual traffic conditions.
•	Data Integrity: Secure database operations with rapid retrieval speeds.
•	User Management: Stable and secure user management via Amazon Cognito.
•	Security: Secure image uploading processes via Amazon S3.
•	Monitoring: Comprehensive API logging through Amazon CloudWatch.
1.3	ASSUMPTIONS
•	Traffic Volume: Moderate traffic levels (less than 100,000 requests/month).
•	Scaling: No requirement for advanced autoscaling configurations.
•	Domain: Domain name is pre-acquired or will be purchased via Amazon Route 53.
•	Competency: The development team possesses proficiency in .NET and React.
2	SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM
2.1	TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM
 
2.2	TECHNICAL PLAN
•	Frontend: Hosted on Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront CDN and HTTPS enabled via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
•	Backend API: .NET runtime environment on AWS Lightsail.
•	Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL hosted on AWS Lightsail.
•	Authentication: Amazon Cognito User Pool.
•	Image Storage: Amazon S3.
•	Logging: Amazon CloudWatch.
•	Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager.
2.3	PROJECT PLAN
The implementation timeline is estimated to range from 6 to 12 weeks, contingent upon the final project scope.
2.4	SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
•	Access Control: S3 private access configured, granting read permissions exclusively to CloudFront.
•	Credential Management: API utilizes private keys stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager.
•	Encryption: Full system-wide HTTPS implementation.
•	Authentication Security: User login protected by Amazon Cognito.
