	"content": "Jewelry E-Commerce Platform Cloud-Based Online Sales System Using React, .NET, and MySQL on AWS Lightsail 1. Project Overview Jewelry E-Commerce Platform is a modern online retail system built on a cloud infrastructure, designed for small and medium-sized jewelry businesses. The project aims to help these enterprises transition from traditional sales models to a secure, flexible, and automated digital environment.\nThe platform integrates a ReactJS front-end, a .NET Core backend hosted on Amazon Lightsail, and a MySQL database for managing products, users, and orders efficiently.\nStatic assets such as product images and web content are stored on Amazon S3 and globally distributed through Amazon CloudFront, ensuring optimal speed and security. Amazon Cognito handles user authentication, while Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Lightsail Snapshots provide monitoring, auditing, and disaster recovery.\nThis project delivers a cost-effective, easy-to-operate, and scalable e-commerce solution tailored for small and medium jewelry businesses.\nProject Objectives Develop a responsive, user-friendly jewelry e-commerce website that works seamlessly across devices. Centralize management of products, inventory, and orders. Ensure ≥99.9% uptime through automated backup and recovery. Maintain infrastructure costs below USD 65/month using Lightsail and AWS Free Tier resources. Business Value Small jewelry shops often face challenges related to high infrastructure costs and limited technical expertise. This solution helps:\nReduce operational costs with predictable Lightsail pricing. Automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency. Enhance brand trust through system stability and robust data protection. 2. Problem Analysis 2.1 Current Situation The jewelry retail market is rapidly shifting to online channels, driven by consumer demand for personalization, transparency, and high-quality digital experiences — especially among younger generations. However, most existing e-commerce systems face critical limitations:\nPoor user experience: Slow page loading, outdated design, and lack of interactive features such as AR try-on. Lack of trust: Customers hesitate to purchase high-value items (gold, diamonds) due to concerns over data security and authenticity. Insecure, outdated infrastructure: Many legacy systems store passwords or customer data in plain text, making them vulnerable to attacks and limiting scalability. 2.2 Key Challenges Speed and reliability:\nJewelry relies heavily on high-resolution imagery and interactive content (e.g., 360° views, AR try-on). Without a global CDN, loading such content becomes slow and unreliable, resulting in high cart abandonment rates.\nSecurity and fraud risks:\nE-commerce platforms are prime targets for cyberattacks. Without a Web Application Firewall (WAF), systems are exposed to SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and data breaches. Storing credentials directly in code poses severe risks of unauthorized access.\nData loss and recovery issues:\nTransactions and inventory records must be 100% accurate. Local storage risks permanent data loss if hardware fails. Without durable storage like Amazon S3, essential data such as invoices and product images could become irretrievable.\nLimited monitoring and control:\nWithout centralized monitoring tools such as CloudWatch, operators can only detect issues after customers report them, increasing MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) and damaging user trust.\n2.3 Stakeholder Impact Stakeholder Key Impact Customers Gain confidence through fast, transparent, and secure online shopping. Operations Team Easier system monitoring, with automated backup and recovery processes. Developers Faster development through modular architecture with API Gateway and Lightsail. Business Owners Continuous business operations, reduced data loss risk, and stronger competitive advantage. 2.4 Business Consequences Revenue loss: Slow performance and poor UX reduce conversions and increase cart abandonment. Reputation and compliance risks: Data breaches (from missing WAF or Secrets Manager) can result in heavy penalties and long-term brand damage — especially in the luxury goods sector. Higher operational costs: Lack of automated monitoring and backup increases manpower and recovery time. Limited scalability: Legacy systems fail to adapt to fast market growth, causing missed business opportunities. 3. Solution Architecture 3.1 Architecture Overview The proposed architecture is a high-performance e-commerce platform deployed on the AWS Cloud (Singapore Region) using a separated SPA/microservices design. This enables dynamic processing and high scalability:\nStatic Frontend Delivery: React frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) are stored on S3 and served via CloudFront CDN for global low-latency delivery. Dynamic Backend Processing: Business logic and data (catalogs, carts, orders) are handled through a .NET API hosted on Lightsail, exposed securely via API Gateway. 3.2 AWS Services Used Category AWS Service Primary Function Networking \u0026amp; Edge Route 53, CloudFront, WAF, ACM DNS routing, CDN delivery, web protection, SSL management Compute \u0026amp; API API Gateway, Lightsail API endpoint management and backend application hosting Identity \u0026amp; Access Cognito, Secrets Manager Authentication/authorization and secure credential management Storage \u0026amp; Database S3, Lightsail MySQL Static asset storage and relational database for transactional data Resilience \u0026amp; Backup AWS Backup, S3 Versioning, Glacier, Lightsail Snapshots Automated backups, archiving, and data version control Monitoring \u0026amp; Audit CloudWatch, CloudTrail Real-time performance tracking and API activity auditing 3.3 Component Design Presentation Layer (Frontend): Static React site hosted on S3, distributed via CloudFront. AWS WAF provides edge-level protection from common exploits. Application Layer (Backend): API Gateway validates Cognito tokens, manages API requests, and enforces throttling. Lightsail Instance (Ubuntu) runs the .NET Core API for handling business logic (orders, products, payments). Data Layer: MySQL Database on Lightsail manages all relational data; credentials stored securely in Secrets Manager. Amazon S3 stores user uploads, product images, and other static assets. 3.4 Security Architecture Edge Protection: WAF filters malicious requests; ACM enforces HTTPS encryption. User Authentication: All login and registration are handled by Cognito with secure token validation. Infrastructure Security: Secrets Manager ensures sensitive credentials are never stored in plain text. Auditing: CloudTrail records every API call for compliance and traceability. 3.5 Scalability and Observability Global scalability via CloudFront caching and distribution. Unlimited storage growth on S3 for media assets. Resource monitoring through CloudWatch metrics, enabling proactive scaling decisions. 4.

	"content": " How iFood Built a Platform to Run Hundreds of Machine Learning Models with Amazon SageMaker Inference By Daniel Vieira, Debora Fanin, Gopi Mudiyala, and Saurabh Trikande – April 8, 2025, in the Advanced section (300), Amazon SageMaker Data \u0026amp; AI Governance, Customer Solutions.\nIntroduction Headquartered in São Paulo, Brazil, iFood is a privately held national company and a leader in food tech in Latin America, processing millions of orders every month. iFood stands out for its strategy of integrating advanced technology into its operations. With the support of AWS, iFood has developed a powerful machine learning (ML) inference infrastructure using services like Amazon SageMaker to create and deploy ML models efficiently. This collaboration has allowed iFood to not only optimize internal processes but also provide innovative solutions for its delivery partners and restaurants.\niFood\u0026rsquo;s ML platform includes a set of tools, processes, and workflows developed with the following main objectives:\nAccelerating the development and training of AI/ML models, making them more reliable and easier to reproduce. Ensuring that the deployment of these models into production is reliable, scalable, and traceable. Enabling transparent, accessible, and standardized testing, monitoring, and evaluation of models in production. Figure 1. Overview — iFood and the application of AI/ML in their product system.\nGoals and Approach To achieve these goals, iFood leverages SageMaker to streamline model training and deployment. By integrating SageMaker features into iFood\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure, key steps are automated — from creating training datasets, training models, deploying them into production, to continuously monitoring their performance.\nThis article outlines how iFood uses SageMaker to enhance the entire ML lifecycle — from training to inference — and describes architectural changes and capabilities developed by the team.\nAI Inference at iFood iFood leverages its AI/ML platform to enhance customer experience across various touchpoints. Some typical use cases include:\nPersonalized Recommendations — Models analyze order history, preferences, and context to suggest appropriate restaurants and dishes, increasing customer satisfaction and order volume. Smart Order Tracking — The system predicts delivery times in real-time by combining traffic data, restaurant preparation times, and the location of the delivery driver, proactively notifying customers. Automated Customer Service — AI chatbots handle thousands of common requests daily, providing fast responses and retrieving relevant data to support personalization. Grocery Shopping Support — The app integrates language models that help customers create shopping lists from voice or text requests. Thanks to these initiatives, iFood can forecast demand, optimize processes, and deliver consistent user experiences.\nSolution Overview (Legacy Architecture) The diagram below illustrates iFood\u0026rsquo;s legacy architecture, where Data Science and Engineering teams had separate workflows — leading to challenges when deploying real-time ML models into production.\nFigure 2. Legacy Architecture — Describing data flow and the barriers between teams.\nPreviously, data scientists developed models in notebooks, fine-tuned, and published artifacts. Engineers then had to integrate these artifacts into the production system, causing delays and integration errors. To address this, iFood developed an internal ML platform to unify the process from development to deployment, creating a seamless experience for both teams.\nUpdated Architecture and ML Go! One of the core capabilities of iFood\u0026rsquo;s ML platform is providing the infrastructure to serve predictions. The internal platform (called ML Go!) is responsible for managing the deployment process, overseeing SageMaker Endpoints and Jobs. ML Go! supports both offline (batch) and real-time (online) predictions, and manages the lifecycle of models (registry, versioning, monitoring).\nFigure 3. Updated Architecture — Including pipelines, model registry, and inference components.\nThe platform provides:\nAutomated ML pipelines (SageMaker Pipelines) for model training and retraining. ML Go! CI/CD to push artifacts, build Docker images, and trigger pipelines. SageMaker Model Registry for versioning and model management. Monitoring mechanisms to detect drift and performance degradation. Final Architecture: Inference Components \u0026amp; ML Go! Gateway A significant improvement is the abstraction concept connecting with SageMaker (Endpoints \u0026amp; Jobs) called ML Go! Gateway, along with separating \u0026ldquo;inference components\u0026rdquo; in the endpoint — helping to divide concerns, accelerate delivery, and manage resources more efficiently. Endpoints now manage multiple inference components, and ML Go! CI/CD only focuses on model version promotion, without deep intervention in infrastructure.\nFigure 4. Final Architecture — Inference components, ML Go! Gateway, and integration with service accounts.\nIn this new structure:\nEndpoints can contain multiple inference components, allowing load distribution by function or load. ML Go! Dispatcher/Gateway forwards requests to the appropriate endpoint or job. CI/CD handles artifacts (Docker images, configs), and SageMaker Pipeline orchestrates training → evaluation → registry → deployment. Using SageMaker Inference Model Serving Containers Standardizing the environment through containers is a crucial element of modern ML platforms. SageMaker provides built-in containers for TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, and more, as well as the ability to use custom containers.\niFood focuses on using custom containers to:\nStandardize ML code (not directly using notebooks in production). Package dependencies, libraries, and inference logic in an image (e.g., BruceML scaffolding). Easily recreate training and serving environments, monitor results, and debug. BruceML helps standardize the way training and serving code is written, creating a scaffold compatible with SageMaker (autotuning, deployment hooks, monitoring).\nAutomating Deployment and Retraining (ML Pipelines \u0026amp; CI/CD) iFood uses SageMaker Pipelines to build CI/CD for ML: pipelines are responsible for orchestrating the entire data flow — from preprocessing, training, evaluation, to promotion in the Model Registry and deployment. ML Go! CI/CD integrates with the organization’s CI/CD system to:\nPush artifacts (code + container image). Trigger training and evaluation pipelines. Automatically register models into the Model Registry. Deploy or promote models to the appropriate endpoint (online / batch). Depending on SLA:\nBatch inference: Uses SageMaker Transform jobs for large-scale predictions. Real-time inference: Deploys models to SageMaker Endpoint with the appropriate container/instance configuration. SageMaker Pipelines helps automate and coordinate complex workflows, reducing errors and shortening development cycles.\nRunning Inference at Different SLA Formats iFood uses multiple inference methods to meet different requirements:\nReal-time endpoints for low-latency tasks (user-facing). Batch transform jobs for large-scale data processing, periodic recommendations. Asynchronous inference (SageMaker Asynchronous Inference) for time-consuming inference tasks. Multi-model endpoints (GPU) to host multiple models on the same GPU endpoint, optimizing resource use. The improvements in collaboration between iFood and the SageMaker Inference team include:\nOptimizing cost and performance for inference (reducing ~50% of cost for some workloads, lowering ~20% average latency when using inference components). Improving autoscaling to handle spikes more effectively (shortening scaling time, enhancing detection of scale events). Easier deployment of LLM / Foundation Models (FM). Scale-to-zero feature for endpoints helps save costs when there is no traffic. Multi-model GPU endpoints reduce infrastructure costs in multi-model scenarios. Model Optimization and Packaging Some technical points iFood focuses on:\nStandardizing containers for both training and serving. Automating the build/publish of images to the registry (ECR). Packaging LLM / FM for faster deployment. Supporting autoscaling and scale-to-zero for dev/test environments and low-traffic workloads. Achieved Benefits \u0026amp; Impact The benefits iFood has gained:\nReduced time to get models into production (faster time-to-market). Increased pipeline \u0026amp; artifact reuse across teams. Lower operational costs through GPU/multi-model optimization and scale-to-zero. Improved stability and model management at scale. Conclusion By leveraging SageMaker capabilities, iFood has transformed its approach to ML/AI: building a centralized ML platform (ML Go!), automating data flows, standardizing containers, and collaborating with the SageMaker Inference team to optimize efficiency, cost, and scalability. This has helped iFood:\nBridge the gap between Data Science and Engineering. Deploy hundreds of ML models reliably. Create a reference platform for organizations wishing to apply inference at scale. “At iFood, we are leading the way in applying AI and machine learning technologies to transform\u0026hellip; The lessons learned have helped us create our internal platform, which can serve as a blueprint for other organizations\u0026hellip;”\n– Daniel Vieira, Director of ML Platforms at iFood.\nAbout the Authors Daniel Vieira — Director of Machine Learning Engineering at iFood.

	"content": " How Salesforce Business Technology Uses AWS Direct Connect SiteLink for Reliable Global Connectivity By Alexandra Huides and Corey Harris Jr – May 9, 2025, in the AWS Direct Connect SiteLink section.\nIntroduction Salesforce Business Technology has used AWS Direct Connect SiteLink to build a global hybrid network architecture, ensuring flexible, high-performance, and reliable connectivity.\nThis solution helped Salesforce scale its infrastructure, reduce operational costs, and accelerate innovation in its journey toward cloud modernization with AWS.\nThis article is brought to you in collaboration with Georgi Stoev and Ravi Patel – senior technical experts at Salesforce.\nOverview Salesforce is an AWS strategic partner and the world leader in customer relationship management (CRM).\nThe Business Technology team is responsible for building and operating enterprise applications that support areas such as finance, data centers, security, data warehousing, and Salesforce\u0026rsquo;s virtual machines.\nWith a global presence, Salesforce needed a network architecture that was:\nFlexible and highly scalable. Minimized latency and downtime. Ensured high security and reliability. However, traditional internet-based network solutions couldn\u0026rsquo;t meet these stringent requirements.\nThis is why AWS Direct Connect SiteLink was chosen — providing a private, dedicated connection, bypassing the public internet to significantly improve security and latency.\nPrerequisites Before deployment, the Salesforce technical team understood the following AWS network components:\nAmazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) AWS Transit Gateway AWS Direct Connect These services form the foundation for the global hybrid network architecture, allowing for private, low-latency connectivity between multiple Direct Connect locations without going through intermediate AWS regions.\nAWS Direct Connect SiteLink AWS Direct Connect provides a private network connection between on-premises infrastructure and AWS, optimizing performance, latency, and reliability.\nSiteLink is an extension feature of Direct Connect that allows direct connections between on-premises networks via the global AWS backbone, enabling:\nData transmission through the shortest path, bypassing AWS regions. Leveraging the global AWS network to transfer data quickly and securely. Pay-per-use pricing, without needing to establish new connections. How it works:\nEstablish an on-premises connection to AWS at one of over 100 Direct Connect locations worldwide. Create a Virtual Interface (VIF) on that connection and enable SiteLink. When VIFs are attached to the same Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW), data is transmitted directly between locations using the AWS backbone. Salesforce Business Technology\u0026rsquo;s Global Footprint Salesforce Business Technology manages 7 strategic locations globally:\n3 in the United States 3 in the Asia-Pacific region 1 in Europe The network is built on private MPLS backbone links combined with AWS Regions, supporting complex data flows between data centers and cloud environments.\nHowever, challenges arose including:\nStatic and hard-to-scale infrastructure. High operational costs and heavy reliance on multiple providers. Routing complexity and outages in some regions. Figure 1. A sample global private data center connection using dedicated circuits.\nSolution: SiteLink To solve these problems, Salesforce Business Technology modernized its network infrastructure by deploying SiteLink.\nThe main objectives were:\nBuild a flexible, scalable network as needed. Reduce operational costs and complexity. Enhance resilience and security. The team:\nDeployed SiteLink on existing Direct Connect connections. Created new dedicated VIFs for production and development environments. Maintained a global segmentation to meet on-premises data storage requirements. Figure 2. Sample global SiteLink deployment for Production and Development.\nAchieved Benefits The SiteLink solution delivered several outstanding benefits for Salesforce:\nBenefit Description Simplified network management Eliminated the complexity of MPLS Layer 3 VPN routing while maintaining traffic isolation. Improved performance Increased stability, reducing global average latency by 15%. Cost optimization Utilized existing connections with pay-per-use billing. Enhanced security Applied MACSec Layer 2 encryption on all Direct Connect connections. Additionally, SiteLink helps:\nReduce single points of failure (SPOF) and improve network reliability. Optimize data path routing between data centers. Comprehensive monitoring via CloudWatch Network Monitor. “With SiteLink, Salesforce Business Technology has streamlined network operations and ensured maximum resilience for global connectivity. We can set up connections between 7 data centers in just a few minutes and expand into new markets in a few days.”\n— Ravi Patel, Senior Technical Director at Salesforce.\nConclusion Adopting AWS Direct Connect SiteLink has helped Salesforce:\nUnify its global network architecture. Modernize infrastructure, reduce costs, and improve performance. Be ready for scaling and rapid innovation. To learn more about AWS Direct Connect SiteLink, you can refer to the official documentation or ask questions on AWS re:Post.\nAbout the Authors Alexandra Huides\nSenior Network Solutions Architect at AWS.\nSpecializes in large-scale network architecture, helping clients adopt IPv6 and build flexible environments.

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nGetting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Using Microservices Data lakes can help hospitals and healthcare facilities turn data into business insights, maintain business continuity, and protect patient privacy. A data lake is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.\nThis blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, “Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.\nArchitecture Guidance The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others. The microservices are loosely coupled via publish/subscribe messaging centered in what I call the “pub/sub hub.”\nThis solution represents what I would consider another reasonable sprint iteration from my last post. The scope is still limited to the ingestion and basic parsing of HL7v2 messages formatted in Encoding Rules 7 (ER7) through a REST interface.\nThe solution architecture is now as follows:\nFigure 1.
